Okay, First things first, the frontpage (For Now) is the Etherpad Lite Homepage, Don't worry. It's not permanent. It's just until I can figure out how I should design the frontpage.

DocBook is a simple no-collaboration editor, but in real-time. Meaning, you can have a lot of users, but only one editor. 

*Is this the intended purpose? 
	Yes. It is designed for presentations.

*How Do I install?
	It's pretty self-explanatory. Just run 'npm install sqlite3' and then execute 'node server.js'

And, logging Issues and Debugging help. A LOT. This was my first NodeJS application from scratch, so, Please be nice...

It runs on port 2004 and requires DocRoot.
